# How do I see the current table compression ratio?
Duration: 10 minutes

The DBMS_COMPRESSION package gathers compression-related information within a database environment. This includes tools for estimating compressibility of a table for both partitioned and non-partitioned tables, and gathering row-level compression information on previously compressed tables. This gives the user with adequate information to make compression-related decision. 

*GET\_COMPRESSION\_RATIO procedure analyzes the compression ratio of a table, and gives information about compressibility of a table. Various parameters can be provided by the user to selectively analyze different compression types.*

## Get Table Compression Ratio

**Login to SQLPlus and run the following statement:**

Using Advisor â€“ The GET\_COMPRESSION\_RATIO Procedure. Compression advisor typically provides fairly accurate estimates, of the actual compression results that may be obtained, after implementing compression.

following parameters have been used in the below procedure
 
* blkcnt\_cmp: Number of blocks used by the compressed sample of the object 

* blkcnt\_uncmp: Number of blocks used by the uncompressed sample of the object 

* row\_cmp: Number of rows in a block in compressed sample of the object 

* row\_uncmp: Number of rows in a block in uncompressed sample of the object  

* cmp\_ratio: Compression ratio, blkcnt\_uncmp divided by blkcnt\_cmp 
 
* comptype\_str: Compression type

Run procedure.

```
<copy>  
set serveroutput on
DECLARE
    blkcnt_cnt pls_integer;
    blkcnt_uncmp pls_integer;
    row_cmp pls_integer;
    row_uncmp pls_integer;
    cmp_ratio pls_integer;
    blkcnt_cmp  PLS_INTEGER;
    comptype_str varchar2(100);
    cmptype_str VARCHAR2(1000);
BEGIN
DBMS_COMPRESSION.GET_COMPRESSION_RATIO ('SYSTEM', 'SH', 'SALES', '', DBMS_COMPRESSION.COMP_ADVANCED, blkcnt_cmp, blkcnt_uncmp, row_cmp, row_uncmp, cmp_ratio, cmptype_str);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Block count compressed = '|| blkcnt_cmp);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Block count uncompressed = '|| blkcnt_uncmp);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Row count per block compressed = '|| row_cmp);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Row count per block uncompressed = '|| row_uncmp);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Compression type = '|| comptype_str);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Compression ratio = '|| cmp_ratio);
END;
/  

</copy>
```

In this example for the Sales table the uncompressed block count is 1532 whereas the compressed block count is 573, the compression ratio is 3, which is uncompressed block count divided by the compressed block count. *Compression Ratio helps determine the table size when compressed*.
